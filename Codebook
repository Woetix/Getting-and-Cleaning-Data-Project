Data

Data is coming from  (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
The dataset includes the following files:

    'README.txt'
    'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
    'features.txt': List of all features.
    'activity_labels.txt':Links the class labels with their activity name.
    'train/X_train.txt': Training set
    'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
    'test/X_test.txt': Test set
    'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
    'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
    'test/subject_test.txt':  same as above,but for the test data
  
  Data in the inertial signals folders is not used on this analysis
  
Variables
The tidy data set containts the average of all means and standard deviations related measurements , per activity and per subject

Variables in the tidy data set are :
"Subject"
"Activity"
"tBodyAcc.mean...X" : average of tBodyAcc.meanX for Activity and Subject
"tBodyAcc.mean...Y":
"tBodyAcc.mean...Z"
"tGravityAcc.mean...X"
"tGravityAcc.mean...Y"
"tGravityAcc.mean...Z"

Transformations

Datasets from train and testsets (x-data) are merged into one data set for the X values
All measurements containing "mean()" and "std()" are extracted
The subject information ( y -data) is added to the selection of the means and standarddeviation measures
Columnnames for "Subject" and "Activity" are added
Activity numbers are replaced with appropriate activity names ( from "activity_labels.txt)
For each subject and activity, averages for each value are calculated
